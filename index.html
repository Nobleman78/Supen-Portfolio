                    values and
                    love for learning. I completed my schooling at Tewfa Ideal School, where I built a strong academic
                    foundation and developed a deep curiosity about the world. After graduating from high school, I
                    pursued higher secondary education at Khagrachari Cantonment Public School and College.
                    After Completed my college life i got admitted in Chittagong University of Engineering and
                    Technology in Civil Engineering. During graduation life I got partipated in many event which is
                    academic and non academic those are really beneficial. I got an internship during graduation time
                    which is really helped me practically interacting with work and I learned so much from that.

                    Outside academics, I enjoy travelling,reading, playing sports , music.
                    which helps me relax and express myself creatively. Whether Iâ€™m exploring new ideas or simply
                    spending time with friends and family in my hometown, I always strive to stay curious and passionate
                    about what I do.
