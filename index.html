                <h2>Short Biography</h2>
                <!-- If you want to highlist any text wrap this i span -->
                <p><span>Supen Chakma</span> is (add your biography here) Dr. Md Aftabur Rahman has been a Faculty of
                    the <span>Civil Engineering Department of Chittagong University of Engineering & Technology</span> since November
                    2008. Dr. Rahman earned his Ph.D. with a specialization in Geotechnical Engineering from the
                    Yokohama National University, Japan, in 2016. He also had a Master's in Civil Engineering from
                    Saitama University and a B.Sc in Civil Engineering from the Chittagong University of Engineering and
                    Technology.

                    Dr. Rahman has contributed to landslide-induced hazard mitigation by developing an analytical model
                    for estimating flow velocity accounting anomalies in widely used velocity estimation procedures.
                    Moreover, his contribution is noteworthy as he pointed out the effect of the flow path of detached
                    landslide mass during his study in Japan. While doing research at Saitama University in Japan, he
                    was working on response analysis of underground pipelines under different fault conditions using the
                    realistic numerical model, and his research has gained much acceptance by the researchers in the
                    buried pipe community, been proven by the citation received under the published paper in a highly
                    reputed journal. Upon returning to the country, Dr. Rahman devoted himself to finding rational
                    solutions to geotechnical hazards, keeping primary aim to contribute to country's ongoing
                    development works. He has been actively doing research in Ground Improvement methods using locally
                    available and waste materials, aiming to reduce the construction cost and preserving the safety of
                    the structure. In addition, he continues his expertise in geotechnical hazard analysis by
                    concentrating on estimating the liquefaction hazard of the Chattogram, the second-largest city.

                    Dr. Rahman serves the academia as a reviewer of distinguished journals. In addition, he was the
                    organizing secretary of an international conference held in Bangladesh in 2018. He also contributed
                    to academia as a technical secretary of an international conference in 2020. He has completed
                    several funded research projects, including one from the University Grants Commission of Bangladesh.
                    Scholarly journals and proceedings have been published from those research projects, and some are
                    under review for possible publications.

                    Besides academic activities, Dr. Rahman provides consultancy services in many national projects as
                    an expert member of the Bureau of Research, Testing, and Consultation (BRTC), CUET, and as an
                    Individual Expert. His professional services include basic material testing, sub-soil investigation,
                    foundation design and vetting, geotechnical complex problem analysis, etc.
